## About
I wrote this application in about a month and a half, I expect issues to arise as soon as it is tested on the field but should hold together reasonably. It was made as a way to improve my knowledge of both C and embedded programming, take it for what it is, an exercise. All critiques are welcome, I don't expect to update this very much but maybe I'll write a better, more feature rich version in the future.

## Known Issues
> [!CAUTION]
Saving and loading does not work on real hardware, I plan to fix this in the near future if I can.

## Thanks
This project is based on the [libtonc template](https://github.com/gbadev-org/libtonc-template), instruction there on how to build it.
Thanks to the all the great resources on [gbadev](https://gbadev.net) and all of the people that wrote them for, in turn, making this project possible.

An additionl thank you to my friends for recording the samples used in the project, also help in general on the topic of drum machines and occasionaly code.
