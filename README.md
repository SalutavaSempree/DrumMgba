# DrumMgba, version1.0
A Drum Machine for the Game Boy Advance console for use on emulators or on real hardware, you are free to use it for any of your music projects of any nature.

## About
I wrote this application in about one month and a half, I expect issues to arise as soon as it is tested on the field but should reasonably hold together. It was made as a way to improve my knowledge of both C and embedded programming, take it for what it is, an exercise. All critiques are welcome, I don't expect to update this very much but maybe I'll write a better, more feature rich version in the future.

## Known Issues:
Saving and loading does not work on real hardware, I plan to fix this in the near future if I can.

## Thanks
